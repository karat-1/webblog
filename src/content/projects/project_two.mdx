# A High-Performance VFX Library for Pygame

This **VFX library** is an in-development **rendering framework** for **Pygame**, focused on **efficient visual effects** without relying on GPU shaders. Since **Pygame primarily relies on SDL2’s software renderer**, real-time effects like glow, lighting, and blur are often expensive in terms of performance.

By leveraging **caching, batching, and CPU-side optimizations**, this library aims to make advanced visual effects possible while maintaining **smooth performance** in Pygame-based games.

## The Problem with Pygame's Rendering

Pygame’s rendering is mostly **CPU-bound**, which makes effects that normally rely on shaders (such as glow, lighting, and blur) difficult to implement efficiently. Common challenges include:

- **High CPU usage** when applying per-frame effects
- **No built-in GPU acceleration** for fragment processing
- **Expensive operations** like per-pixel blending and transformations

## Optimized Rendering Approach

This library tackles these issues by:

- **Batching draw operations** to minimize redundant rendering calls
- **Effect caching** to reuse precomputed visuals instead of recalculating each frame
- **Optimized mathematical operations** using **Numba** for CPU-based performance boosts
- **Software-based post-processing**, such as **blurring, glow effects, and lighting simulations**

While Pygame lacks direct **shader support**, certain performance-intensive calculations (e.g., **procedural effects and pixel manipulation**) can still be accelerated using **Numba** or **OpenCL** where applicable. However, the actual rendering remains CPU-driven due to SDL2's software renderer.

## Features & Capabilities

- **Lighting system** with dynamic glow and shadow effects
- **Optimized particle rendering** to reduce CPU overhead
- **Procedural effects**, such as distortion, waves, and color manipulation
- **Customizable effects** that can be layered and combined

## Open Source Release

This **VFX library will soon be open-sourced**, making it accessible to all developers looking to enhance their Pygame projects with optimized visual effects.

Stay tuned for the public release and documentation!
