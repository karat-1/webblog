      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>
        I'm a <strong>software developer</strong> with a focus on <strong>backend systems, DevOps, and game development</strong>. My experience spans
        full-stack development, cloud infrastructure, and low-level programming, with a strong emphasis on performance, maintainability, and clean architecture.
      </p>

      <h2>Software Development</h2>
      <p>
        Professionally, I work with <strong>backend services, REST APIs, and DevOps tools</strong>, leveraging technologies like Docker, Kubernetes, and CI/CD pipelines 
        to streamline development workflows. I also have experience in frontend development, working with modern frameworks to build accessible UI components.
      </p>

      <h2>Game Development</h2>
      <p>
        In addition to software engineering, I have a deep interest in <strong>game development</strong>, particularly in physics-based mechanics, procedural world design, 
        and performance optimization. I'm currently developing a <strong>low-resolution microvania game</strong>, experimenting with movement systems and enemy behaviors.
      </p>

      <h2>Interests</h2>
      <p>
        I enjoy tackling complex problems, refining development processes, and constantly exploring new technologies. Whether it's optimizing software architecture, 
        building efficient DevOps pipelines, or designing game mechanics, I'm always looking for ways to improve and innovate.
