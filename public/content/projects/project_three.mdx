# Ichimonji – A Compact Microvania

**Ichimonji** is a small-scale **microvania**, built around the idea of making an **interconnected world as dense and interesting as possible** within a strict size constraint of **1024x512 pixels**.

The name comes from the **Ichimonji attack** in _Sekiro_, a **single, deliberate strike**—which fits the game’s design as the protagonist primarily relies on **one powerful attack** rather than a complex combo system.

## Design Philosophy

While inspired by **Pico-8-style limitations**, **Ichimonji does not strictly adhere** to them when it comes to:

- **Functionality** – No artificial memory constraints
- **Graphics & Palette** – A minimal but flexible approach
- **File Size** – Not limited, though still compact by design

However, the game **does** follow a **low-resolution aesthetic** with a **64x64 pixel viewport**, making every design decision matter.

## Challenges & Approach

Designing a **metroidvania-like world** within such a **small space** creates a unique challenge:

- **No wasted space** – Every screen must serve a purpose
- **Exploration-focused** – A tiny world still needs discovery & surprises
- **Layered movement & progression** – Compact but interconnected

Instead of sprawling environments, the game emphasizes **tight, well-structured** level design, forcing interesting choices in **navigation, enemy placement, and upgrades**.

## Development & Release

Ichimonji is still in development, with **most of the core mechanics and engine work complete**. The game is expected to release **later this year**, along with code and tools used in its creation.

Ichimonji is an experiment in **doing more with less**, embracing constraints to create something unique. Stay tuned for more updates!
