# Pyco16 – A Lightweight 2D Framework

**Pyco16** is a custom **2D game framework** inspired by **Pico-8**, but built with **Pygame** and **SDL2** as its foundation. The goal of Pyco16 is to provide a **lightweight, easy-to-use engine** for small 2D games, without requiring deep optimizations for Pygame’s rendering.

## Why Pyco16?

By default, **Pygame uses SDL2's software renderer**, which often makes optimization a crucial factor in game performance. Pyco16 abstracts away most of these concerns while keeping development **simple and efficient**.

Key features include:

- **A modular 2D engine** with built-in game loop management
- **Seamless integration with LDtk**, a powerful level editor
- **Optimized use of SDL2** to improve rendering where possible
- **Minimal dependencies**, keeping the framework lightweight

## LDtk Integration

Pyco16 comes with **direct support for LDtk** (Level Designer Toolkit), making it easy to import and manage level data. LDtk allows for **quick level creation** while Pyco16 handles efficient rendering and entity management.

## Screenshots

## Conclusion

Pyco16 is designed for developers who want to create **small, efficient 2D games** without the overhead of traditional Pygame optimizations. The framework simplifies rendering, input handling, and level management, allowing you to focus on building your game.
